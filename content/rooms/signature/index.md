Here we are proud to present to you our beautiful Signature Suite. Arguably the best of all our suites. Probably more suitable for longer stays as it benefits from having a small Kitchenette including an under-counter fridge/freezer, microwave, toaster and sink. It has been carefully designed to give you that self-contained, stylish and memorable stay.

This suite benefits from having a ‘his and hers’ latest technology push-out balcony. Being hidden away on the second floor, the suite enjoys far-reaching countryside views. Within the seating area, you will find complimentary tea and coffee facilities and cereal dispenser (as in all our suites). It has its own television additional to the television in the tastefully presented bedroom area. Adjacent to the kitchenette is an ensuite shower room. 

This is truly an amazing place to spend your well deserved short break. A hidden gem providing a stay for you to enjoy and remember.
